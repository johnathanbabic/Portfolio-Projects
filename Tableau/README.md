This demonstrates some of my Tableau knowledge that I use for data visualization. I extracted the data using the sql script and put them into the various excel files. The data is from January 28, 2020 to September 14, 2021. The live dashboard can be viewed at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/johnathan.babic/viz/CovidData_16320836932710/Dashboard2?publish=yes.
